A platform dedicated to advancing Open Educational Resources (OER) in higher education. Built in collaboration with CUNY's Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, this tool empowers faculty to create, share, and maintain high-quality educational materials that are freely accessible to all students.

## üéØ Why OER Matters

Research consistently shows that OER initiatives:
- Reduce the financial burden on students, with studies showing average textbook savings of $100+ per course
- Improve student success rates and course completion
- Allow for more equitable access to educational materials
- Enable faculty to customize and update content to meet specific learning objectives
- Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing across institutions

*"OER adoption does much more than simply save students money and address student debt. OER enables faculty to adapt and customize learning materials to meet the needs of their students."* - SPARC OER State Policy Playbook

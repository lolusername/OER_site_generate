# Introduction to Chemical Bonding

Chemical bonding is one of the most fundamental concepts in chemistry. It explains how atoms combine to form molecules and compounds.

## Types of Chemical Bonds

### 1. Ionic Bonds
- Form between metals and non-metals
- Involve complete transfer of electrons
- Result in formation of charged ions

### 2. Covalent Bonds
- Form between non-metals
- Involve sharing of electrons
- Can be single, double, or triple bonds

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. Identify different types of chemical bonds
2. Explain the formation of ionic and covalent bonds
3. Predict bond types based on electronegativity differences

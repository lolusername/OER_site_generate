Introduction to Computer Science Notes
====================================

Key Concepts:
------------
1. Algorithms
   - Step-by-step procedures for solving problems
   - Examples: Sorting, Searching, Path Finding

2. Data Structures
   - Arrays: Fixed-size, contiguous memory
   - Linked Lists: Dynamic size, non-contiguous
   - Trees: Hierarchical data organization

3. Programming Paradigms
   - Imperative: Step-by-step instructions
   - Object-Oriented: Objects and classes
   - Functional: Pure functions, immutability

Important Terms:
---------------
- Compiler: Translates high-level code to machine code
- Interpreter: Executes code line by line
- Debugging: Finding and fixing errors
- Version Control: Tracking code changes

Study Tips:
----------
1. Practice coding daily
2. Break problems into smaller parts
3. Use pseudocode for planning
4. Test your code thoroughly
5. Document your work
